 ##FlappyBirdAI
 -AI play FlappyBird via Machine Learning and OpenCV
  
 -**in developing... not finished yet**
 -
 -##Trying it out
 -1. run FlappyBirdAI.exe
 -2. visit: FlappyBird webpage version [online-link](http://ben7th.github.io/flappy-html5-bird/) or [offline(gamebin/index.htm)](gamebin/index.htm)
 -3. Move mouse pointer above FlappyBird to make AI auto-control start
 -
 -##How it works
 -1. Take snapshots of the game graphics via Windows API
 -2. Recognize bird and pipes in snapshots via OpenCV
 -3. Obtain states of bird by watcher classes within State Machine
 -4. Predicate contact-time via Linear Regression
 -5. Auto click the mouse to make bird jump via Windows API
 -6. simple Self-Training to get higher scores
